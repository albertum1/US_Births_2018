## Introduction
For this dataset, 'DBWT'(Birth Weight) will be my target variable. A baby's weight can be used as proxy to determine a baby's health. Skinny babies can sometimes be alarming and make parents feel vulnerable. I am for healthy babies. I'll be using linear regression to find a best-fit line and break down it's coefficients to analyze what's important.
