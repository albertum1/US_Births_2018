## Introduction
For this dataset, 'DBWT'(Birth Weight) will be my target variable. Under weight babies can be healthy even though they are small, however, low-weight babies can have some serious problems. I'll try to create a best fit-line and interpret some of its coefficients.

## Key Insights
The purpose of this project is to find some variables that can best explain the variances of the baby birth weight. In a normal world, there should be no differences among baby weights regardless of features. However, we don't live in a normal world. Creating a best-fit line and interpretting its coefficients can bring light into why there might be such differences. 
Calculating a human baby's weight can be very complex. Nonetheless, we can still try to draw some understanding of what may determine a babies weight.
